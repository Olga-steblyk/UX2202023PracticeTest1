    <h1>Difference between writing in google docs and in html documents</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Some of the differences between writing in google docs and html can fall in to the actual writing part it self. While writing in google docs, the user just simply has to write what they are trying to say and not think about how to format, generally, but in the case of HTML, they need to be more aware of how they are writing like using tags and writing in the correct place. Html documents are meant to be read by and recognized as a coding language rather than just simply a language.  </p>
